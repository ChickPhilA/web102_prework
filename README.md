# WEB102 Prework - Sea Monster's Treasures
Submitted by: Philipe Manio

Sea Monster's Treasures is a website for the company Sea Monster Crowdfunding that displays information about the games they have funded.

Time spent: 2 hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [✅] The introduction section explains the background of the company and how many games remain unfunded.
* [✅] The Stats section includes information about the total contributions and dollars raised as well as the top two most funded games.
* [✅] The Our Games section initially displays all games funded by Sea Monster Crowdfunding
* [✅] The Our Games section has three buttons that allow the user to display only unfunded games, only funded games, or all games.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [✅] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality! (see below)

- Center most of the text (e.g. the title at the very top of the webpage, description, header tags, etc.) to give the webpage a clean and centered-focused look
- Create the website description in its own header container, with larger text size to emphasize the company's purpose, history, and value(s)
- Provide a glow animation for the 3 different buttons when you hover over them
- Provide a transition (ease-in-out type) animation for the game cards when you click over the 3 different buttons of funded, unfunded, and all games, to provide a sleek feel to the user
- Possibly split the whole webpage into different webpages, where a navigation bar on the top lets you click to different webpages of the website, where each webpage focuses on statistics, games, mission & values, etc.

The latter detailed above have not been implemented, but rather are strong features that I would integrate within my webpage to give the project a more interactive and dynamic user experience.

## Video Walkthrough
